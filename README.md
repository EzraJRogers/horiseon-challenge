# horiseon-challenge
ASU coding boot camp first challenge.

In this challenge I switched non-semantic html to semantic html.
I changed a div section with links into a nav.
I switched the span in the Horiseon name to a paragraph and styled it to match the heading.
I converted the main sections of the web pages from divs to sections.
Within those sections I changed divs to articles that would be found in each section.
